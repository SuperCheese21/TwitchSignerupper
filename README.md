## Why Did You Make This?
The reason for making such a script was to expose current issue(s) in the signup process on TwitchTV that allows individual(s) to automate such processes for the creation of numerous bot accounts with the purpose/intent of spamming/abusing Twitch channels and the Twitch services.
